- 👋 Hi, I’m Cenkay Martin.

- ⏳ I'm currently learning Java.

About me:

📖 Before starting kindergarten, I learned to read and write at the age of 4-5. Thanks to my older brother, I was introduced to computers and the internet at a very young age. I would sit in front of the computer, and the first thing I wondered about when examining any website or program was how it was made. This was true for all programs, websites, and games. It would give me great pleasure to research, try and experience.

My journey began with Python in the 8th grade. I developed various automation programs on Instagram and Facebook using the Selenium module and worked as a freelancer. Later in high school, I became interested in game development. I developed various games by following Unity courses and participated in the TUBITAK project organized at our school. I developed the "resfebe" word game to accelerate the word learning skills of primary school children.

Throughout high school, we took various courses related to my field. Some of these included Python, C#, C++ (for Arduino), HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, etc. When I was in the 11th grade, I developed a mobile game using App Inventor for my project assignment. I'm currently in the 12th grade. There are so many things I want to tell, but I can't fit them here... In short, that's it. Thank you very much for taking the time to read.

🙂🙏
